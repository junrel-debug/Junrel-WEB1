          <h3>Sakamoto's overweight appearance after retiring.</h3>
          <p class="image-description">Sakamoto is a tall, fat man with slicked back gray hair that is tied into a ponytail at the back of his head (similar to a man bun) and he has a small broom mustache. He typically wears an apron over a T-shirt and long pants. Sakamoto prefers to wear slippers, even when outside. His eyes are usually hidden by the glare of his round glasses.</p>

          <h3>Sakamoto during his days as an assassin</h3>
          <p class="image-description">In the past, Sakamoto was much leaner with no mustache. His facial features were more defined and his eyes were visible through his glasses. Through burning through his accumulated calories, Sakamoto can revert to this form for a power boost. Shin notes his transformed appearance makes him look handsome.</p>
